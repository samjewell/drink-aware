ToDo

- [X] try with multiple URLs (just no params)
- [X] get it onto Github pages
- [X] get the 'save to home screen' hint working
- [X] learn how to clear the cache on iOS? It's in the OS settings, but can also delete and reinstall the browser!


Notes

- put every file under NETWORK as well as under CACHED
- once the html file is cached, how can I get it to reload changes to that html file?

- Scaling will reduce pixel perfection, but use the whole screen size
- Not scaling will keep pixel perfection, but add extra white around the edge :-(
- Is it more important it looks great in the show? Or on the screens of the nurses?
  - **Probably the former**
  - if so, **scale down from native resolution?**
